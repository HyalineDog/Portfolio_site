### Plic

Bringing digital connections to life in your physical space

**Tags:** Product Design, UX Research, Prototyping, Participatory Design

**My Role:** Lead Product Designer

**Duration:** 10 weeks

**Challenge:** Create a physical product that reminds users of their important contacts in a noticeable yet unobtrusive way, transforming the often utilitarian nature of digital contact lists into meaningful interactions.

**Solution:** Developed Plic, a small, wooden device that opens like a book, featuring a video-chat screen on one side and a mirror with a camera on the other. Each Plic is paired with a specific contact, allowing users to place multiple devices around their home for easy access to their closest connections.

## Key Contributions:

- Conducted comprehensive research including outreach questionnaires and contextual inquiries to identify user needs and pain points in maintaining digital connections
- Led ideation sessions resulting in over 60 ideas, which were then refined through a structured down-selection process
- Facilitated participatory design workshops to gain valuable user insights and iterate on the product concept
- Designed and prototyped the final Plic device, including its book-like form factor and transparent charging dock
- Developed the user interface for the video-chat screen, focusing on simplicity and ease of use
- Created a seamless pairing process between Plic devices and users' smartphones
- Integrated user feedback to create a product that seamlessly fits into users' daily lives and spaces

## Potential Impact:

- Anticipated to strengthen long-distance relationships by providing a tangible, always-present connection to loved ones
- Expected to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, particularly among elderly users or those living alone
- Potential to increase the frequency and quality of communication between family members and close friends
- Projected to create a more intuitive and accessible way for less tech-savvy individuals to engage in video calls
- Anticipated to transform how users interact with their digital contacts, providing a physical representation of digital connections
- Potential to inspire new product categories that bridge the gap between digital convenience and emotional significance
