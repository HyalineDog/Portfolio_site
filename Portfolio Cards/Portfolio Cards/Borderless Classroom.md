**Tags:** Lead UX Designer, User Experience Architect, Flow Analysis, Design Strategy

**My Role:** Lead UX Designer

**Duration:** 6 months

**Challenge:** Address the significant educational resource inequality between urban and rural areas in China, which limits opportunities for millions of rural students. Traditional methods have failed to effectively bridge this gap, leaving rural students at a disadvantage.

**Solution:** Developed the Borderless Classroom Product, an innovative system leveraging iFlytek smartboards to connect resource-rich urban classrooms with multiple rural classrooms simultaneously. This solution enables urban teachers to deliver high-quality lessons to rural students, effectively bridging the resource gap.
