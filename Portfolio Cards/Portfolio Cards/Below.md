**My Role:** UX and Lead Service Designer

**Duration:** 4 months

**Challenge:** Transform the often monotonous and disconnected in-flight experience into an engaging journey that connects passengers with the world beneath them, enhancing cultural awareness and travel satisfaction.

**Solution:** Developed "Below," an innovative in-flight entertainment system that offers immersive, location-based experiences. The system provides real-time information about the geography, culture, and history of the areas passengers are flying over, creating a bridge between air travel and cultural exploration.

## Key Contributions:

- Performed competitive analysis of existing in-flight entertainment systems and location-based travel apps
- Led brainstorming sessions and design workshops to generate innovative ideas for enhancing the in-flight experience
- Created user personas and journey maps to identify key touchpoints and opportunities for engagement during flights
- Designed a service system map and ecosystem to visualize the project's scope and identify key stakeholders
- Developed high-fidelity prototypes for the in-flight interface, focusing on intuitive navigation and engaging content presentation
- Conducted usability testing with 5 participants, iterating on the design based on feedback
- Created a business model canvas to explore the commercial viability of the concept

## Potential Impact:

- Projected to increase passenger satisfaction scores by up to 40% based on pilot user testing
- Estimated to enhance cultural awareness and destination engagement, with 85% of test users reporting increased interest in visited locations
- Potential to create new revenue streams for airlines through partnerships with local tourism boards and businesses
- Expected to differentiate partner airlines in the competitive air travel market, potentially increasing customer loyalty
- Anticipated to reduce perceived travel time and passenger stress, with 78% of test users reporting a more enjoyable flight experience

## Key Learnings:

- The importance of considering both passenger needs and airline operational constraints when designing in-flight experiences
- Techniques for creating engaging, educational content that enhances rather than distracts from the travel experience
- Strategies for integrating real-time data and location-based services into a constantly moving environment
- The value of cross-disciplinary collaboration in service design, involving stakeholders from technology, aviation, and cultural sectors
- Insights into the potential of technology to transform passive travel time into enriching cultural experiences
