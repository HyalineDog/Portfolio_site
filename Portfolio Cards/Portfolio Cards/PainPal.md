### PainPal

Revolutionizing chronic pain management with wearable technology

**Tags:** UX Research, UI Design, Product Design, Prototyping, Healthcare Innovation

**My Role:** Lead UX Designer

**Duration:** 3 months

**Challenge:** Develop an innovative solution to help people living with chronic pain manage their condition more effectively and communicate nuanced pain levels with their care team. The goal was to address the limitations of traditional pain assessment methods and provide continuous, accurate pain data.

**Solution:** Conceptualized PainPal, a multi-modal solution combining a wearable biosensor patch with web and mobile interfaces to track, analyze, and report chronic pain data. The system aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a patient's pain experience over time.

## Key Contributions:

- Conducted extensive research using data from the CDC and American Journal of Managed Care to create a comprehensive journey map of chronic pain patients
- Designed an innovative wearable patch concept using octopus-inspired technology for improved skin adhesion and comfort
- Created wireframes and high-fidelity designs for the mobile app interface, focusing on intuitive pain reporting and data visualization
- Explored various form factors for the wearable patch to optimize user comfort and functionality
- Developed a system to compare baseline pain levels with perceived pain for more accurate reporting
- Designed an interface for healthcare providers to easily interpret and analyze patient pain data
- Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to ensure the concept aligned with medical best practices and Eli Lilly's goals

## Potential Impact:

- Anticipated to improve pain management strategies for chronic pain patients by providing more accurate, continuous data
- Projected to enhance communication between patients and healthcare providers, potentially leading to more effective treatment plans
- Expected to reduce the subjectivity in pain reporting, offering a more standardized approach to pain assessment
- Potential to contribute to the development of more personalized pain management therapies based on detailed patient data
- Designed to empower patients with better insights into their pain patterns, potentially improving their quality of life
- Anticipated to provide valuable data for research into chronic pain, potentially accelerating the development of new treatments
