Empowering communities with accessible public health insights

**Tags:** UX Research, UI/UX Design, Data Visualization, Information Architecture, Usability Testing

**My Role:** Lead UX Designer

**Duration:** 4 months

**Sponsors:** ForumOne and NYU Public Health Department

**Challenge:** Improve the usability and effectiveness of the City Health Dashboard, an award-winning platform that provides critical health data for over 970 U.S. cities. The goal was to better serve community leaders, policy influencers, and citizens in understanding and addressing health challenges in their communities.

**Solution:** Conducted a comprehensive usability review and redesign process, focusing on enhancing data comparison tools, improving navigation, optimizing data accessibility, and refining visual design to make the platform more intuitive and impactful for its diverse user base.

## Key Contributions:

- Led user interviews and surveys with public health professionals, policymakers, and community leaders to gather insights on their data needs and usage patterns
- Performed heuristic evaluation to identify key usability issues in navigation, data visualization, and design systems
- Conducted usability testing with 5 participants to validate findings and gather additional user feedback
- Developed comprehensive recommendations for improving data comparison tools, map interactions, and information architecture
- Created high-fidelity prototypes in Figma to visualize proposed improvements and new features
- Designed an improved data visualization system that makes complex health metrics more accessible to non-expert users
- Collaborated closely with ForumOne and NYU Public Health Department to ensure the redesign met both technical and academic standards

## Impact:

- Improved data comprehension among users, with 80% of test participants able to accurately interpret key health metrics after the redesign
- Enhanced the platform's accessibility, achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and improving usability for users with disabilities
- Streamlined the process of comparing health metrics across cities, reducing the time required for this task by 50%
- Received positive feedback from 80% of beta testers, who reported that the new design made it easier to find and understand relevant health data

## Key Learnings:

- Techniques for translating complex data sets into intuitive, user-friendly visualizations
- Strategies for designing interfaces that cater to users with varying levels of data literacy
- The importance of balancing academic rigor with user-centered design in public health tools
- Methods for effectively collaborating with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (academia, government, and technology)
- Insights into the unique challenges of designing data-driven platforms for public policy and community health
- The value of iterative design and continuous user testing in refining complex information systems
