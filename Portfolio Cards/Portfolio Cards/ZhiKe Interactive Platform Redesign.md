**Tags:** Lead UX Designer, User Experience Architect, Flow Analysis, Design Strategy, Ethnographic Research

**My Role:** Lead UX Designer

**Duration:** 8 months

**Challenge:** After 5 years of feature additions, the ZiKe platform had become cumbersome and intimidating, resulting in low teacher adoption rates and high churn. The platform, serving over 130 million students, needed a comprehensive overhaul to improve usability and effectiveness.

**Solution:** Executed a comprehensive redesign of the interaction model and user experience, prioritizing simplification, consistency, and intuitive design across all platform features and devices.

## Key Contributions:

- Led ethnographic studies in 20 classrooms across different regions to identify key pain points and prioritize features
- Conducted flow analysis of 50+ features to understand user patterns and identify areas for improvement
- Redesigned less-used features by applying insights from popular ones, simplifying interactions and improving overall coherence
- Created a unified experience across 50+ features and all supported devices (tablets, computers, and smart boards)
- Developed a streamlined UI focused on quick startup and ease-of-use with a clean, intuitive interface
- Implemented a new design system to ensure visual and functional consistency across the platform
- Facilitated cross-platform iteration to ensure a consistent experience across various devices
- Collaborated closely with engineering, QA, and customer success teams for seamless execution and implementation

## Impact:

- Achieved a significant 29.2% increase in active users following the redesign launch
- Reduced teacher onboarding time, improving adoption rates among new users
- Decreased feature discovery time, enabling teachers to utilize more of the platform's capabilities
- Improved student engagement, with a 25% increase in interactive feature usage during lessons
- Reduced support tickets related to UI confusion by 50%, alleviating pressure on the customer success team
- Increased teacher satisfaction scores from 6.8 to 8.9 out of 10 in post-redesign surveys
