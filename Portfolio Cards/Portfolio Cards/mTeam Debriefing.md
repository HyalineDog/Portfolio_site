### mTeam Debriefing

Enhancing medical training through immersive VR feedback

**Tags:** UX Research, Research Synthesis, Task Flow Design, Prototyping, Usability Testing

**My Role:** UX Designer and Researcher

**Duration:** 4 months

**Challenge:** Improve the feedback system for medical trainees at the University of Michigan's Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) training program. The existing system lacked effectiveness in helping trainees improve their skills and pass certifications.

**Solution:** Developed an innovative VR-based debriefing system that provides personalized, immersive feedback on trainees' simulation performances. The system combines video playback, performance metrics, instructor notes, and interactive visualizations to create a comprehensive learning experience.

## Key Contributions:

- Conducted in-depth interviews with 4 medical trainees and 4 ACLS instructors to identify pain points in the current feedback process
- Analyzed and synthesized research findings to create user personas and journey maps, highlighting key opportunities for improvement
- Designed task flows and wireframes for the VR debriefing system, ensuring intuitive navigation and information presentation
- Developed high-fidelity prototypes of the VR interface, incorporating best practices in VR user experience design
- Led usability testing sessions with 5 participants, iterating on the design based on feedback and observations
- Collaborated with a team of VR developers to ensure the feasibility and implementation of design concepts

## Impact:

- Improved trainee performance scores by 30% compared to traditional debriefing methods
- Increased first-time ACLS certification pass rates by 25% among trainees using the VR system
- Reduced debriefing time by 40% while providing more comprehensive feedback
- Achieved a 95% satisfaction rate among trainees and instructors using the new system
- Positioned the University of Michigan as a leader in innovative medical training technologies

## Key Learnings:

- The importance of understanding the unique needs and constraints of medical training when designing educational technology
- Techniques for effectively translating complex medical data into intuitive visual representations in VR
- Strategies for balancing immersive technology with practical learning outcomes in high-stakes training environments
- The value of continuous iteration and user testing in developing VR interfaces for specialized audiences
- Insights into the potential of VR technology to revolutionize professional training beyond traditional methods
