### Ciadini Chapter 1

- Fixed-action patterns (Click, Whirr): specific triggers that would result in specific reaction
- We have fixed-action patterns to save us from mental distress and to have the speed of decision-making; ours are learned (through language and society, etc.)
    - The plane crash example (they took off, something is wrong, the captain insists there is nothing wrong, copilot listened, they crashed) is also a fixed-action pattern; the fixed-action is also because of the authority of the captain.
    - An old man is having a stroke and cuts the triangle shape of the skull to release the head; another patient also cuts off the triangle shape on a different side. The nurse asked if we needed to follow standard procedure, and the Doctor said no, that is an authority trigger.
    - Expansive = good; over price means something is good. In general, we think we get what we pay for
    - Contrast principle: in comparing the two things, one thing after another, we will focus more on the difference. (Order matters a lot) → judgment bias
    - Anchor effect: if you tell me something first, you put an anchor on me, and my response will depend on your anchor.
    - Judgmental heuristics are mental shortcuts that people will make when making decisions.
- Animals have fixed action patterns because, most likely, they are innate; they respond to specific actions. It is harder to override.

### Duhigg - The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business

- What starts the habit loop? (Discussion)
    - → People’s conscious awareness
    - → People’s carving for reward
    - → People latch on to certain sensations during the routine
- What starts the habit loop? (Lecture)
    - **They crave a reward, but first, they need to be consciously aware of the need for a reward.**
        - Beliefs also can change people’s behavior; it is fundamental for behavior and changing behavior.
- Craving is really the key to starting a habit loop; it is also changing beliefs.
    - Julio’s example is that the monkey sees shapes on the screen and pulls level, and the monkey will get juice as a reward. Initially, the brain wave shows that monkeys have high dopamine levels after receiving the reward. But as the pattern goes, as soon as the cue happens, the dopamine will already be spiking.
    - The rat hits the button and gets a fixed reward, and another gets a chance of reward; the rat with an opportunity will press the button more → It could create constant cravings for reward and continuous chasing of that feeling.

### Becker - The Economic Approach to Human Behavior

- Assumption:
    - Maximizing behavior
        - Everyone is optimizing their behavior and choice
    - Market equilibrium
        - demand and supply will reach an equilibrium
    - Stable preference
        - if you have A or B and choose A, you will always choose A
- Theory of the optimal or rational accumulation of costly information
    - It is the theory that people will make greater investments in information when making a big, costly decision.
    - This explains why the decisions might not be rational because of the information gap.
- “Shadow” price
    - prices in other shapes or forms, more of the trade-offs that are not monetary.
- Heisenberg indeterminacy principle
    - Also known as the uncertainty principle, it is a fundamental theory in quantum mechanics stating that it is impossible to know a particle's exact position and momentum simultaneously. This principle highlights the inherent limitations in measuring quantum systems.
    - Economically, a person only chooses to follow if they expect the benefits.

### Levitt, S.D. & Dubner, S.J.(2005). Freakonomics

- Roe v. Wade caused a dropping crime rate. But it was mentioned zero time.
- Incentives are going to guide decision-making
- Experts have their best interests in mind, but not your
