### The topics of this class

The economy is the study of allocating scarce resources to satisfy competing ends.

Social psychology is the discipline that uses scientific methods to understand and explain how the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of other human beings

### What is Theory?

Theory is the educated guess in a specific defined boundary of study and topics

first, we observe the phenomenon, and then we try to explain the data and the process that will result in the output.

### What does theory do?

Organize our knowledge.

Help us predict behavior in new situations

tell us what date is worth gathering

suggests ways to analyze new data.

So we can understand the correlation between input and output.

Allow us to make more effective decisions.

The theory is to guide us in thinking about the new problem after having met a new environment

### Data Sources

**Experimental sources**

- Field (naturally occurring) vs Laboratory (artificial decision-making environment)
- characterized by controlled conditions

**Happenstance sources (data wasn’t strictly produced to test your circumstances)**

- Field vs Laboratory
- Characterized by uncontrolled processes

### What is the purpose of experiments?

Experiment is in a controlled environment, we can track and check under the guidance of the theory by changing one variable to validate the theory.

- Discover empirical regularities
- Test conflicting theories
- Develop a theory
- Set boundary conditions for a particular theory
- As a test bed
    - studying a new institutional design before going “live”
