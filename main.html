          <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Educational resource inequality between urban and rural areas in China
            limits
            opportunities for rural students. Traditional methods fail to address this disparity.</br>

            <br><strong>Solution: </strong> Developed the Borderless Classroom Product, leveraging iFlytek smartboards
            to
            connect classrooms in resource-rich urban areas with those in rural areas. This allows urban teachers to
            deliver high-quality lessons simultaneously to multiple rural classrooms, bridging the resource gap.</br>

            <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Led the design and implementation of the smartboard integration system, enabling seamless
              cross-classroom interaction.</br>
            <li>Collaborated with educators to develop engaging lesson plans suitable for diverse environments.</li>

          <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>Pilot programs demonstrated significant improvements in rural students'
            academic performance and engagement. Borderless Classrooms is poised to revolutionize education in China by
            promoting equal access to quality learning experiences.</br></p>

          <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>China's "Double Reduction" policy challenged education companies.
            Concerns
            about screen time and student vision
            health pushed us to create a more comprehensive solution than just E-ink screens.</br>

            optimization.
            It has user-friendly interface designed specifically for student needs and workflows.</br>
