          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Redesign IngTube's vendor front-end experience to accommodate new features and create
            an intuitive interface that aligns with the company's evolving business model.</p>
      
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed two distinct prototypes - one based on the original influencer-centered
            model and another reconceptualizing the platform as a comprehensive ad management system.</p>
      
          <p><strong>My Impact:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Created an initial prototype that streamlined the campaign creation process for brands</li>
            <li>Collaborated cross-functionally to summarize product rules and reorganize data structures</li>
            <li>Conceptualized and designed a new model that transformed IngTube into an ad management system</li>
            <li>Developed flexible subsystems within the new model to accommodate future features</li>
            <li>Successfully presented and justified the new model to leadership and various departments</li>
            <li>Influenced the company's product strategy by having the new model adopted for implementation</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> The reconceptualized ad management model was adopted by IngTube, fundamentally changing
            their product interaction framework. This new approach provides a more scalable and flexible platform that can
            easily accommodate future features and growth, positioning IngTube for long-term success in the influencer
            marketing industry.</p>

          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Address multiple usability issues in ZhiKe's problem bank system,
            including inefficient space utilization, inconsistent layout, and poor content visibility, while balancing the
            needs of different stakeholders.</p>
      
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed two comprehensive redesign proposals that addressed key issues, improved
            content visibility, and enhanced overall user experience for both teachers and students.</p>
      
          <p><strong>My Impact:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducted a thorough analysis of existing problems, categorizing issues by their root causes and responsible
              departments</li>
            <li>Proposed two distinct design solutions that addressed space utilization, content alignment, and interaction
              issues</li>
            <li>Collaborated with visual design, interaction, resource, and courseware teams to ensure holistic
              problem-solving</li>
            <li>Designed flexible layout rules to accommodate various content types (text, images, tables) and improve
              readability</li>
            <li>Considered the impact of design changes on different use cases, including large-screen interactions</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> The proposed redesigns offer significant improvements to ZhiKe's problem bank system,
            addressing longstanding usability issues and enhancing the overall learning experience. By considering various
            stakeholder needs and technical constraints, the solutions provide a solid foundation for implementing a more
            effective and user-friendly interactive learning platform.</p>
