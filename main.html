          <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Educational resource inequality between urban and rural areas in China
            limits
            opportunities for rural students. Traditional methods fail to address this disparity.</br>

            <br><strong>Solution: </strong> Developed the Borderless Classroom Product, leveraging iFlytek smartboards
            to
            connect classrooms in resource-rich urban areas with those in rural areas. This allows urban teachers to
            deliver high-quality lessons simultaneously to multiple rural classrooms, bridging the resource gap.</br>

            <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Led the design and implementation of the smartboard integration system, enabling seamless

            Concerns
            about screen time and student vision
