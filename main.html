          <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Educational resource inequality between urban and rural areas in China
            limits
            opportunities for rural students. Traditional methods fail to address this disparity.</br>

            <br><strong>Solution: </strong> Developed the Borderless Classroom Product, leveraging iFlytek smartboards
            to
            connect classrooms in resource-rich urban areas with those in rural areas. This allows urban teachers to
            deliver high-quality lessons simultaneously to multiple rural classrooms, bridging the resource gap.</br>

            <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Led the design and implementation of the smartboard integration system, enabling seamless
              cross-classroom interaction.</br>
            <li>Collaborated with educators to develop engaging lesson plans suitable for diverse environments.</li>
            <li>Contributed to reducing educational inequality by providing rural students with access to top-tier
              resources and instruction.</li>

          </p>

          <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>Pilot programs demonstrated significant improvements in rural students'
            academic performance and engagement. Borderless Classrooms is poised to revolutionize education in China by
            promoting equal access to quality learning experiences.</br></p>

          <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>The final design features an engaging, holistic experience combining video,
            metrics, instructor notes, insightful visualizations, and gamification to empower immersive excellence in
            medical training. The system also gathers comprehensive data from each training session, providing anonymous

          <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>China's "Double Reduction" policy challenged education companies.
            Concerns
            about screen time and student vision
            health pushed us to create a more comprehensive solution than just E-ink screens.</br>

            <br><strong>Solution: </strong>The E-ink student pad with a balance of hardware and software
            optimization.
            It has user-friendly interface designed specifically for student needs and workflows.</br>

            <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Led the design team to move beyond basic E-ink hardware optimization.</li>
            <li>Championed a user-centered approach, prioritizing student workflows.</li>
            <li>Developed a task-based interface to minimize distractions and enhance learning.</li>
            <li>Pioneered a UX-centered 0-1 product development workflow for future projects.</li>
          </ul>
          </br>
          </p>

          <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>Despite top-down requirements, I saw an opportunity to transform
            tablets into
            a classroom-ready tool. By leveraging user research and design theories, I created a task-based interface
            that
            resonated with student workflows. This tailored user experience addressed E-ink limitations while promoting
            focused
            learning through purpose-built features.</p>
          <p>Our goal was not a generic tablet, but a unique learning experience. This human-centric approach
            aimed to
            improve academic outcomes by providing students with an intuitive and distraction-free tool.</p>
