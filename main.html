        <h3>Borderless Classroom</h3>
        <h4>Lead UX Designer</h4>
        <h4>User Experience Architect</h4>
        <h4>Flow Analysis</h4>
        <h4>Design Strategy</h4>
        <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Educational resource inequality between urban and rural areas in China limits
          opportunities for rural students. Traditional methods fail to address this disparity.</br>

          <br><strong>Solution: </strong> Developed the Borderless Classroom Product, leveraging iFlytek smartboards to
          connect classrooms in resource-rich urban areas with those in rural areas. This allows urban teachers to
          deliver high-quality lessons simultaneously to multiple rural classrooms, bridging the resource gap.</br>

          <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Led the design and implementation of the smartboard integration system, enabling seamless cross-classroom
            interaction.</br>
          <li>Collaborated with educators to develop engaging lesson plans suitable for diverse environments.</li>
          <li>Contributed to reducing educational inequality by providing rural students with access to top-tier
            resources and instruction.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        </p>

        <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>Pilot programs demonstrated significant improvements in rural students' academic
          performance and engagement. Borderless Classrooms is poised to revolutionize education in China by promoting
          equal access to quality learning experiences.</br></p>

        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Medical trainees at the University of Michigan at Advanced Cardiovascular
          Life Support (ACLS) training need a better
          feedback system on their simulation performances to improve their skill set and pass certifications.</br>

          <br><strong>Solution: </strong>The Game Changer in ACLS Training - A Decade of Grooming Medical Leaders. This
          product has helped improve the unique
          training for each medical professional. Allowing for better feedback and training.</br>

          <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Identified the need for a more effective feedback system through user research.</br>
          <li>Contributed to creating a user-centered design through user testing and iteration. </li>
          <li>Designed a solution that leverages VR's potential to personalize feedback and improve skill development for ACLS trainees.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        </p>

        <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>The final design features an engaging, holistic experience combining video,
          metrics, instructor notes, insightful visualizations, and gamification to empower immersive excellence in
          medical training. The system also gathers comprehensive data from each training session, providing anonymous
          student feedback and identifying recurring areas of difficulty to help instructors refine their lectures and
          address common student misunderstandings.</br></p>

        <h4>Design Strategies</h4>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>China's "Double Reduction" policy challenged education companies. Concerns about screen time and student vision
        health pushed us to create a more comprehensive solution than just E-ink screens.</br>

          <br><strong>Solution: </strong>The E-ink student pad with a balance of hardware and software optimization. It has user-friendly interface designed specifically for student needs and workflows.</br>

          <br><strong>My Impact: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Led the design team to move beyond basic E-ink hardware optimization.</li>
          <li>Championed a user-centered approach, prioritizing student workflows.</li>
          <li>Developed a task-based interface to minimize distractions and enhance learning.</li>
          <li>Pioneered a UX-centered 0-1 product development workflow for future projects.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        </p>

        <p><br><strong>Result: </strong>Despite top-down requirements, I saw an opportunity to transform tablets into a classroom-ready tool. By leveraging user research and design theories, I created a task-based interface that resonated with student workflows. This tailored user experience addressed E-ink limitations while promoting focused learning through purpose-built features.</br>
        <br>Our goal was not a generic tablet, but a unique learning experience. This human-centric approach aimed to improve academic outcomes by providing students with an intuitive and distraction-free tool.</br></p>
